Release 1.0.1 - 17 Jan 2016
===========================================================================

POP Commerce 1.0.1 is a minor new feature and bug fix release.

This release is based on Moqui Framework version 1.6.0, Mantle Business
Artifacts version 1.2.0, and SimpleScreens version 1.0.0.

While there are a few new screens and improvements to the admin and
ecommerce apps the main changes in this release are quality related. There
are now screen render tests, run on every git push though Travis CI, and
there were various fixes and improvements done while writing these tests.

Many screens (around 4800 lines) were moved to the SimpleScreens project
for more generic reuse. These changes help POP Commerce focus on being an
industry specific suite of applications while making it easier for other
applications to reuse more generic functionality that was in POP Commerce.
POP Commerce also no longer depends on HiveMind with this move to
SimpleScreens.

The eCommerce application currently has 16 screens and 20 forms. The admin
application currently has 71 screens and 210 forms. POP Commerce has around
3.7k lines of text, mostly in XML files (a small number in FTL, Groovy).

New Features

- Added screen render tests, initially 80 renders
- Added Travis CI configuration and setup automated builds
- Various cleanups and fixes done while screen testing
- Added financial reports based on newer report templates in SimpleScreens
  and services in Mantle, improved existing reports; now includes Balance
  Sheet, Cash Flow Statement, Income Statement, Retained Earnings, and
  Financial Ratios/Metrics
- Now uses the SimpleScreens project instead of HiveMind for Accounting,
  Vendor, etc screens (new dependency on SimpleScreens, no longer depends
  on HiveMind)
- Added simple Category screen in ecommerce app

Bug Fixes

- Fixed product search index and doc type to match DataDocument setup data
